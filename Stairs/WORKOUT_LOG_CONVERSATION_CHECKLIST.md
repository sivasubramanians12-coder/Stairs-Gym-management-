# Workout Log Conversation Checklist - Stairs Gym

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Purpose:** Simple checklist for trainers to fill workout logs via conversation with Claude

---

## üí¨ HOW THIS WORKS

**Instead of filling forms, you chat with Claude:**
- Tell Claude what happened in the session
- Claude asks follow-up questions if needed
- Claude fills the Notion workout log with factual data only
- Takes 2-3 minutes per session

---

## ‚úÖ CONVERSATION CHECKLIST

### Before You Start Talking to Claude:
Say: *"I need to log a workout session for [Patient Name]"*

Then cover these points (Claude will prompt you if you forget):

---

### üìã SECTION 1: Basic Info (Claude will ask if missing)
- [ ] Patient name
- [ ] Date & time
- [ ] Session duration

---

### üí™ SECTION 2: What Did You Do? (Just tell Claude)
- [ ] **Exercises done** - list them with sets/reps/weight
  - Example: "We did 3 sets of squats at 50kg, 8 reps each"
  - Example: "Plank holds - 3 sets of 45 seconds"
  - Example: "Balance work - single leg stands, 30 seconds each leg"

**Just speak naturally - Claude will organize it into:**
- Strength exercises
- Mobility/flexibility exercises
- Balance exercises
- Cardio (if any)

---

### üìä SECTION 3: How Did It Go? (Facts only)
- [ ] **Form/technique observations** - what you saw
  - Good: "Form was good on squats, knees tracked well"
  - Good: "Lost balance twice on single leg deadlifts"
  - Bad: "Patient seemed unmotivated" ‚ùå (speculation)

- [ ] **Comparisons to last session** (if you remember)
  - "Squat weight increased from 45kg to 50kg"
  - "Plank time up from 40 seconds to 45 seconds"
  - If you don't remember, that's fine - say "don't know"

---

### ü©π SECTION 4: Any Pain or Issues? (Important!)
- [ ] **Did patient report any pain/discomfort?**
  - If YES: Where? How much (0-10)? During which exercise?
  - Use patient's exact words: "Patient said: 'My right knee hurt during lunges'"

- [ ] **Did you modify any exercises?**
  - If YES: Which exercise? Changed to what? Why?
  - Example: "Changed full lunges to half depth because of knee pain"

- [ ] **Any incidents or safety concerns?**
  - Loss of balance, form breakdown, equipment issues, stopped early?

---

### üí¨ SECTION 5: Patient Feedback (30 seconds)
- [ ] **What did patient say about the session?**
  - Quote them: "Patient said: 'Felt strong today'"

- [ ] **How did patient rate themselves?** (quick ask)
  - Energy level: ___/10
  - How hard was it: ___/10
  - Did they enjoy it: ___/10

---

### üéØ SECTION 6: Next Session Plan (Quick note)
- [ ] **Any changes for next time?**
  - "Increase bench press to 42.5kg next time"
  - "Continue monitoring right knee"
  - "No changes, keep current program"

---

## üó£Ô∏è EXAMPLE CONVERSATION

**Trainer:** "I need to log a workout for John Doe from today's session."

**Claude:** "Got it! Tell me what exercises you did."

**Trainer:** "We did squats - 3 sets of 8 reps at 55kg. Then bench press, 3 sets of 10 at 40kg. Finished with plank holds, 3 sets of 45 seconds each."

**Claude:** "Great. How was his form?"

**Trainer:** "Form was good on everything. Squats were much better than last week - knees stayed aligned."

**Claude:** "Did he report any pain or discomfort?"

**Trainer:** "Nope, no pain today."

**Claude:** "Any changes needed for next session?"

**Trainer:** "Yeah, increase squat weight to 57.5kg next time. He's ready."

**Claude:** "Perfect. How did he rate the session - energy and difficulty?"

**Trainer:** "He said he felt strong today. Energy was 8 out of 10, difficulty was about 6."

**Claude:** "Got it. I'll log all that now. Session duration?"

**Trainer:** "45 minutes."

**Claude:** ‚úÖ "Workout logged: WO-001-T001-20251026-001. All done!"

---

## üö´ WHAT TO AVOID

### DON'T Say:
- ‚ùå "Patient seems tired" (how do you know? ask them)
- ‚ùå "Patient is making great progress" (unless you have measurements)
- ‚ùå "Patient wasn't motivated today" (speculation)

### DO Say:
- ‚úÖ "Patient rated energy 4/10"
- ‚úÖ "Squat weight increased from 50kg to 55kg"
- ‚úÖ "Patient said: 'I'm feeling tired today'"

---

## üì± QUICK MOBILE VERSION

**Absolute minimum to tell Claude:**
1. Patient name & date
2. Exercises with sets/reps/weight
3. Any pain (yes/no, where, how much)
4. Any modifications made
5. Session duration

Claude will ask for more if needed!

---

## üéØ CLAUDE'S JOB

When you tell Claude about the workout, Claude will:
1. ‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions if info is missing
2. ‚úÖ Organize exercises into categories (strength/mobility/balance)
3. ‚úÖ Record ONLY what you said - no filler text
4. ‚úÖ Use your exact words for observations and patient quotes
5. ‚úÖ Create the Notion workout log with proper ID format
6. ‚ùå NOT add motivational language you didn't say
7. ‚ùå NOT invent progress you didn't mention
8. ‚ùå NOT speculate about patient's feelings

---

## üí° TIPS FOR FAST LOGGING

### During the Session:
- Mental note of key numbers (weights, reps, times)
- If patient mentions pain, jot it down immediately
- Ask patient for quick ratings at the end (energy/difficulty/enjoyment)

### After the Session (2-3 minutes):
- Open chat with Claude
- Tell the story of the session naturally
- Claude organizes it into proper format
- Done!
