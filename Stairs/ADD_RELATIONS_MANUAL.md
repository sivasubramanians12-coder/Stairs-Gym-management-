# Adding Relations Between Databases - Manual Steps

Since the API has strict requirements for relations, we'll add them manually in Notion (takes 5 minutes).

## What are Relations?

Relations connect data across databases. For example:
- A PATIENT can have many WORKOUT LOGS
- A WORKOUT LOG belongs to one PATIENT
- This creates a link so data is interconnected

## How Relations Will Work

Once you add relations, you'll be able to:

**Example: PATIENT "John Doe"**
- Click on `Assigned Trainer` â†’ Select "Trainer A"
- Click on `Workout Logs` â†’ It will auto-show all workouts linked to John
- Click on `Assessment Logs` â†’ Shows all assessments

**Example: WORKOUT LOG entry**
- Click on `Patient` â†’ Select "John Doe"
- Now this workout is linked to John's record
- It auto-appears in John's "Workout Logs" relation
