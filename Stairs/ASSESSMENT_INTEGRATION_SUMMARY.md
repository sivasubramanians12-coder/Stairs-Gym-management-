- **Strength Score** (0-100)
- **Mobility Score** (0-100)
- **Balance Score** (0-100)
- **Flexibility Score** (0-100)
- **Goals Set** (rich text)
- **Program Suggested** (rich text)

- **Current Strength Score**
- **Current Mobility Score**
- **Current Balance Score**
- **Current Flexibility Score**
- **Current Overall Score** (calculated)
- **Last Assessment Date**

## üîÑ Assessment Update Logic

### When Patient Records Are Updated
The system updates patient records when:
1. An assessment exists within the reporting period (7 or 30 days)
2. The assessment has at least one valid score
3. The assessment is linked to the patient via relation

### What Happens on Update
```python
1. Check for assessments in date range
2. If found:
   a. Extract all four scores
   b. Calculate overall score (average)
   c. Update 6 fields in PATIENTS database
   d. Include assessment data in report
3. If not found:
   a. Generate report with workout data only
   b. Skip patient record update
```

### Handling Multiple Assessments
If multiple assessments exist in the period:
- **Most recent assessment** is used for patient record update
- **All assessments** can be referenced in monthly reports
- Assessment dates shown in chronological order

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Patient scores not updating
**Possible causes:**
1. Assessment not within reporting period (7 or 30 days)
2. Assessment not linked to patient (relation missing)
3. Assessment missing required fields

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check assessment data
python check_assessment_structure.py

# Verify patient-assessment relations
# Manually run update script
python generate_all_reports_with_assessments.py
```

### Issue: Assessment not showing in report
**Possible causes:**
1. Assessment date outside reporting window
2. Report already exists (won't regenerate)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete old report in Notion
# Re-run generation script
python generate_all_reports_with_assessments.py
```

### Issue: Assessment scores are None/N/A
**Possible causes:**
1. Assessment fields not populated in Notion
2. Field names don't match expected names

**Solution:**
- Verify assessment has all four scores filled in Notion
- Check field names match: "Strength Score", "Mobility Score", etc.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Possible Future Features

3. **Goal Tracking**
   - Link goals from assessments to workout plans
   - Track progress toward assessment-based goals
   - Show goal completion percentage

4. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Compare current scores to baseline
   - Show percentage improvement
   - Highlight strongest/weakest areas
