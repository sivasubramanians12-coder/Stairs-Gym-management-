## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Report already exists" message**
- Solution: This is normal - script prevents duplicates
- Each patient gets one report per week/month
- Delete old report in Notion if you want to regenerate

**Issue: "No workout data in past X days"**
- Solution: Create workout logs for that patient first
- Run `create_sample_workout.py` to add test data

**Issue: "Insufficient workout data (need at least 3 sessions)"**
- Solution: Only applies to monthly reports
- Patient needs 3+ sessions in past 30 days
- This is intentional to ensure meaningful reports

**Issue: Groq API error**
- Solution: Check `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env` file
- Verify API key is still valid at console.groq.com

**Issue: Notion API error**
- Solution: Check `NOTION_API_KEY` in `.env` file
- Verify integration has access to all databases
