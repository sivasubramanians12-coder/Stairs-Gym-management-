## What This System Does

Instead of spending 10 minutes manually entering workout data, you simply **tell Claude what happened** in natural language, and it automatically logs everything to our patient database.

**Old way (10 min):**
1. Open Notion
2. Find patient
3. Create new workout log entry
4. Fill in 12 different fields
5. Copy exercises from notes
6. Format everything
7. Save

**New way (<2 min):**
1. Open Claude chat
2. Say: "Log workout for John. 45 min strength. Bench 3x10@60kg, squats 3x12@80kg. Form improving."
3. Done! ✓

Hey, just finished with Priya. We did 60 minutes today, mostly lower body stuff. 
She did squats 4 sets of 10 reps at 70kg, leg press 3 sets of 15 at 120kg, 
leg curls 3 sets of 12 at 35kg, and calf raises 4 sets of 20 at 50kg.

She's getting way stronger - added 10kg to squats since last month! 
Form is solid. Energy was great. Only thing is she mentioned some tightness 
in her left hip during warm-up but it went away. Might need more stretching.
```

**Claude responds:**

### Example 3: Session with Problems

**You say:**
```
Session with Amit Singh, only got 30 minutes done today.

Started with bench press but he said his right shoulder was bothering him.
Tried one set at 50kg but pain got worse so we stopped.

Switched to legs instead - leg press 3x12 at 100kg, leg curls 3x10 at 30kg.
Those were fine, no pain.

But really concerned about the shoulder. He said it's been hurting for 3 days.
Might be rotator cuff. Told him to see physio before next session.

## Best Practices

### DO ✓

1. **Log Same Day**
   - Log immediately after session
   - Details are fresh
   - Takes just 1-2 minutes

2. **Be Specific**
   ```
   Good: "Bench press 3x10 @ 60kg, form excellent"
   Not: "Did some pressing"
   ```

3. **Note Progress**
   ```
   Good: "Added 5kg to squat, depth improved"
   Not: "Did squats"
   ```

4. **Mention Concerns Immediately**
   ```
   Good: "Right knee pain during leg press, stopped exercise"
   Not: Waiting to log later
   ```

5. **Use Natural Language**
   ```
   Good: "She's crushing it! Energy high, form perfect."
   Not: Formal robot speak
   ```

### DON'T ✗

1. **Don't Wait Days**
   - Log same day, memories fade

2. **Don't Skip Details**
   - Exercises need sets, reps, weight
   - Can't improve what we don't track

3. **Don't Ignore Pain**
   - Always log pain/discomfort
   - System will alert management

4. **Don't Use Abbreviations Claude Doesn't Know**
   ```
   Bad: "BP 3x10@60" 
   Good: "Bench press 3x10 @ 60kg"
   ```

5. **Don't Forget Patient Name**
   - Claude needs to know who

---

## Common Questions

**Q: What if Claude doesn't understand?**
A: Just rephrase. If still confused, use the "clear conversation" command and start fresh.

**Q: Can I use voice?**
A: Yes! On mobile app, just speak naturally.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**
A: Tell Claude: "Actually, change that to..." or go edit in Notion directly.

**Q: How do I log group classes?**
A: Log each patient separately, mention it's a group class.

**Q: What if patient name is similar (two Johns)?**
A: Use full name: "John Smith" not just "John"

**Q: Can I log multiple sessions at once?**
A: Yes! Just say "First session was..." then "Second session was..."

**Q: What if I forget to log?**
A: Log whenever you remember, just specify the date: "Log workout from Oct 24 for..."

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Patient not found"

**Solution:**
```
You said: "Log for Rahul"
Try: "Log workout for Rahul Sharma"
(Use full name from database)
```

### Problem: Claude asks too many questions

**Solution:**
```
Provide more details upfront:
"Log workout for [name], [date], [duration], [exercises with sets/reps/weight], [observations]"
```

### Problem: Forgot what you said

**Solution:**
```
Ask: "What did I just log?"
Claude will summarize the conversation
```

### Problem: Need to change something

**Solution:**
```
Say: "Actually, change the weight on bench press to 65kg"
Or: "Correction: it was 45 minutes not 60"
```
