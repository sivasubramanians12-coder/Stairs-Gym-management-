## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ **Don't:**

1. **Skip reading the documentation**
   - Everything is documented for a reason
   - Saves time in the long run

2. **Change database structure without understanding relations**
   - The 6 databases are interconnected
   - Follow the exact structure first

3. **Deploy without testing locally first**
   - Test on localhost before production
   - Catch bugs early

4. **Train trainers without practice period**
   - Give them time to practice (1 week)
   - Address concerns before full launch

5. **Add all patients at once**
   - Start with 5-10 pilot patients
   - Iron out issues first

### ✅ **Do:**

1. **Follow the sequence**
   - Notion → Backend → Zapier → Testing → Training → Launch

2. **Keep credentials secure**
   - Never commit `.env` file to git
   - Use environment variables

3. **Test each component**
   - Don't move to next phase until current works

4. **Collect feedback early**
   - Ask trainers what they need
   - Iterate based on real usage

5. **Monitor the first month closely**
   - Daily checks initially
   - Fix issues quickly
