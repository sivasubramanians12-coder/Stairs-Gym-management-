## 2. Claude Integration - Workout Logging

### How Trainers Use Claude

Trainers simply **talk to Claude** naturally to log workouts. Claude extracts structured data and saves it to Notion.

### Example Conversations:

**Example 1: Quick Workout Log**
```
Trainer: "Log workout for Rahul Sharma. Today 45 min strength session. 
Did bench press 3x10 at 60kg, squats 3x12 at 80kg, shoulder press 3x10 at 25kg.
Noticed his form on squats is much better, depth improved. Energy was good.
Slight shoulder tightness mentioned, need to watch that."

Claude: "‚úì Workout logged for Rahul Sharma

Date: Oct 26, 2025
Duration: 45 minutes
Exercises:
- Bench Press: 3x10 @ 60kg
- Squats: 3x12 @ 80kg
- Shoulder Press: 3x10 @ 25kg

Improvements: Form on squats better, depth improved
Concerns: Slight shoulder tightness
Session Rating: Good

```

**Example 2: Detailed Session with Multiple Observations**
```
Trainer: "Session with Priya Mehta, 60 minutes today. 
We did upper body - bench press 4x8 at 45kg, rows 4x10 at 40kg, 
lat pulldowns 3x12 at 35kg, bicep curls 3x15 at 10kg, tricep dips 3x10 bodyweight.

She's showing great improvement in pushing strength, added 5kg to bench since last month.
Pull strength still lagging, especially in rows. Form is good but needs more volume there.
Energy level was excellent today, very motivated. She mentioned work stress but it didn't 
affect the workout. No pain or issues. Plan to increase pulling volume next week."
